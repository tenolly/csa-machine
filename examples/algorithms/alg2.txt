# Task "Sum Square Difference" (https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)
#
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385.
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 3025.
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the
# square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
